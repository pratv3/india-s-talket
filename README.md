Talknet is a fast command line based tool which is directly coded from scratch uses the port number 7773 to contact
its main aim is to connect people and give them a taste of command line tools yo just need to put your private ip and name and boom you got the connection
it has logs file also so every attempt is recorded named talknetlogs.txt(host) and talknetMlogs.txt(member) you can erase those logs at any time but be sure its not recomended all time
may be intervals can help!!
and best thing <MADE-IN-INDIA>
thanks!!
